# Mass spectrometry calculation for quantitation.
This repository contains the calculations used for quantitative analysis using mass spectrometry. These skripts should be applicable for general calculations but are mainly designated for the analysis of phthalat samples. The main aspects are general calculations for the experimental setup, the creation of the calibration curve, the error analysis and the statistical considerations required for the general analysis of phthalates concentrations in air samples. In regards to the usage of the scripts aswell as the format of the input .csv files and the output files a short description in the form of a coment is listed in each skript. The main language used is phyton in the form of jupiter notebooks via google colab. The imput and output files for the calculations skripts are uploaded and accesed from my google drive cloud as it allows for easy integration. As these calculations are crucial for my master project certain skripts might be specially suited only for these applications hence would need to be adapted to other applications.
